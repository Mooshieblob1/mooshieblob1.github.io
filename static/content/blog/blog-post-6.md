TypeScript has become increasingly popular in the Vue ecosystem, offering improved developer experience and code reliability. In this post, we'll explore TypeScript best practices specifically for Vue projects. We'll cover topics such as properly typing component props, emits, and refs. You'll learn how to leverage TypeScript's type inference in Vue's Composition API and how to create type-safe Vuex stores. We'll also discuss strategies for gradually adopting TypeScript in existing Vue projects. By following these best practices, you'll be able to write more robust and maintainable Vue applications.

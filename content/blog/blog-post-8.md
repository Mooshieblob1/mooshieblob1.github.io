Custom directives in Vue 3 allow you to extend the template syntax with your own behavior. In this tutorial, we'll dive deep into creating and using custom directives. We'll start with the basics of directive definition and hook functions. Then, we'll explore practical examples such as creating a 'v-focus' directive for auto-focusing inputs, a 'v-click-outside' directive for detecting clicks outside an element, and a 'v-lazy-load' directive for images. You'll learn how to pass arguments and modifiers to your directives and how to make them reactive. By the end of this post, you'll be able to create powerful, reusable directives to enhance your Vue applications.

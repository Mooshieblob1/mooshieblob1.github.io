Building a RESTful API is a crucial skill for full-stack developers. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of creating a RESTful API using Node.js and Express. We'll start by setting up a basic Express server and defining our API endpoints. You'll learn how to handle different HTTP methods, validate input data, and structure your API for scalability. We'll also cover topics such as middleware usage, error handling, and API documentation with Swagger. Additionally, we'll discuss best practices for API security, including authentication and rate limiting. By the end of this guide, you'll have the knowledge to build robust, scalable APIs that can serve as the backbone for your web applications.
